Add any random tweet as a comment to a post, to gather replies in one place.

== Description ==

I get lots of replies on Twitter about my new blog posts and I wanted to save those tweets along with the comments on my blog post. There were other plugins that do this already but there was lot of baggage that came along with it, so here is one tiny plugin that does what I wanted.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `add_tweet_as_comment.php` to the `wp-content/plugins` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the `Plugins` menu in WordPress
1. Go to `Settings > Add Tweet as Comment`, paste any tweet URL and press Submit.
1. That's it!
